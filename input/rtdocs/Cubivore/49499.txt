One thing I admired about this passing generation are those games that really
try something different, unique, or quirky. Deep within the tides of mundacity
are gems that reel you in with a novel concept, then keep you there with a
competent design. That's not to say you need to be unique to be good, but when
you're funky fresh you're just that - fresh.

Of course, Cubivore isn't a completely novel concept. There's older games like
EVO, where you gradually build up an animal or Crush, Crumble and Chomp! which
even then let characters customize a monster from the ground up. Customization
has been a huge draw for games for a long time, so Cubivore's variety of
beastly forms is only half the battle. For the full on assault, we need to
implement the evolving feature in some way, perhaps by eating coloured meat
from the enemy beasts and changing your shape based on the meats you eat? Works
for me.

While Cubivore is very straight forward with the tasks it asks of you, the idea
of the hunt does add to the game. Your quest to mutate and mate until you are
the lord of the Cubviores echoes the drive of real life - to immortalize
yourself in those that come after you.

Cubivore is a game of mutation. You attack an enemy, and eat its meat to change
your form. Your form depends on the colour of meat eaten and of how many limbs
you have. See the next section for info on Colours.

Basics
******

Control Stick: Movement
Camera Stick: Move Camera
Control Pad: EZ Mutation (see EZ Mutate)
L: Lock-On
R: Dash (with Raw Paw)
A: Pounce/Jump
B: Block
Y: Roar
X: Reverse
Z: Doo
Start - Pause

*Lock-On:

Holding the L button locks onto a Cubivore and makes you pounce at that beast
when you hit A. When you have the Raw-Claw, you can do this while moving.
Otherwise, you can only do it in reverse or stopped.

*Dash:

When you have the Raw-Paw, you can Dash. Hold R and move to run fast, but you
will get tired eventually, and won't be able to dash until you catch your
breath.

*Pounce/Jump:

Pouncing is the main form of attacking. Jumping is just a hop, but becomes a
pounce when you lock on. Jumping is the main form of dodging in Cubivore, make
a leap to dodge a pouncing cubivore, then pounce at it yourself.

*Block:

Put up defense to cushion a blow. This is effective against some forms of
attack, and you may want to try it if dodging a pounce throws the enemy too
far out of range.

*Roar:

Scares certain enemies. If you scare an enemy enough to knock it over, you can
take its meat directly.

*Reverse:

Head backwards. Some species have very quick reverse speeds. Reverse will NOT
fatigue your Cubivore as Dash does. Reverse away from a Cubivore and pounce it
as it lands in front of you with its pounce. Or use it as a quick escape
method.

*Doo:

Poop out a colour, the one closest to the left on your little meter. This is
useful when you want to get rid of a colour (such as eating a PaleDark or
Clash Beast) that is not useful to you when you're trying to get a form.

*EZ-Mutate:

A form that you can change into at will. You get EZ-Mutate two ways. One is by
mating, whatever form you pick you can change into at will. The other is by
number of mutations.

Reach a specific number and that mutation becomes useable at will. You can an
EZ Mutate at mutations number 20, 50, 80, and 100. 20 and 100 seem to be the
big ones.

*Training:

You can train in this game your Horns, bonus to attack power, Scar, bonus to
Defense Power, Hump, bonus to the benefit you get from healing items, and your
Tongue, your ability to Eat N' Run. You can also train stomach by eating other
beasts, and this is your HP.

*Start Menu:

Start Menu lets you review rules, check your status, and check your bestiary:
the collection of all beasts you have ever mutated into.

Mating
******

Mating occurs everytime you get a new piece of Raw-Meat. With your new meat,
you can enter the mating grounds and mate with some females.

Depending on the colour of your cubivore, and the number of lovebits, you get
an assortment of colours. The females are coloured Yellow to Grey in groups of
Pale, PaleDark, Dark, Clash, and Rage. The more mutations you get, the more
females you attract.

If you go in with, say a pale grey meat and have access to the pale grey
female, she seems to have a higher chance of producing a child.

If you get 100 lovebits, EVERY female will give birth. Mated forms should be
picked on functionality and availability.

Combat
******

Just the techniques you will use...

*Re-Bite:

Tap the control stick 2 or 3 times to bite into a grabbed piece of meat. This
makes it more difficult for an enemy to escape.

*Double/Triple Gobble:

When you grow a fang, then another fang you can gobble 2, then 3 pieces of
meat at once.

*Diet Plan:

When you can double or triple gobble, you can use diet plan to take only one
piece of meat instead of 2 or 3. Extremely useful.

Hold X and DO NOT re-bite. You should use Diet Plan to get only one piece of
meat. If the species is 3 or less when you can triple, or 2 or less when you
can double, you cannot use diet-plan.

*Eat N' Run:

With Tongue points you can do this. Get directly behind a running enemy, and
run and pounce. You should eat their meats without the usual knock-out. This
is difficult to learn and doesn't appear to work on many strong forms of
cubivores.

*Lost Limbs:

If you lose a limb, eat a Herbibeast or colour meat to regrow it. If you lose
raw-meat, eat the organism that ate it on you.

|                               CV3: Colours                                 |
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The bestiary in Cubivore is fleshed out by degrees of colour and different
colours possessing different traits.

Pale: Pale meat is the weakest, faintest meat.
PaleDark: A paledark is between pale and dark, and is a combination of pale and
          dark meat.
Dark: Dark meat is a meat stronger than Pale.
Clash: Clash beasts have a specific combination of Rage meats, they're stronger
       than dark though generally weaker than Rage.
Rage: Pure rage meat of a colour, generally the top of the category in stats.

Even though a Rage beast may outstrip a Clash beast in stats, there's a
difference in abilities. For instance, the Clash Blue and Rage Blue categories.
The sideways movement of Rage Blue may be disorienting to some, so Clash blue
is easier to handle. Or Clash Red vs Rage Red. Clash Red is much more like Dark
Blue in attack pattern, kind of a mix between Blue and Red traits. Rage Red is,
however, a powerful version of what you've maybe come to expect.

Greyodons generally take priority for EZ mutations in this walkthrough - this
is ONLY a suggestion. If you have an easier time with, say, Purpials then go
that route as well. While Greyodons are enormously powerful, especially the
Rage variety, they may not always have the abilities you seek.

                             ----Yellowbrate----
                                 -----------

Yellowbrates are generally slow beasts with high defense and decent attack and
other stats. Their awkward body shapes and movement may make them a bit tricky
at first, but they're generally a pretty decent clade.

Yellowbrates excel at blocking, but you should never bring a  yellowbrate right
into the fray. It is generally not quick enough to respond to multiple enemies
nor can most of them escape other enemies. A pack of greyodons will tear you to
pieces unless you take them out one at a time.

The upper forms of Yellowbrate fix the speed problem to at least workable
levels. If you get surrounded, and can't run away, block and run.

-==Creating Clash==-
   --------------

Clash 1-Limb - Rage Yellow from a 1-Limb Clash Yellowbrate.
Clash 2-Limb and higher - Any combination of Rage Red and Yellow (one each at
                          least).

*Pale:
Pale Yellowbrates are generally the weakest all around beasts. They may be a
little more physically impressive than Pale Redapeds, but their movement is a
grave impairment.

*Paledark:
Paledark is about the best you can do with Yellowbrates early in the game.
They walk straight and stand a fighting chance.

*Dark:
Dark sort of walk on diagonals. Practice around with them before using them in
an actual fight. They do have decent capabilities.

*Clash:
Clash walk straight and are decent creatures, but Rage is all this and so much
more.

*Rage:
Rage have superior defense and great capabilities. If you want a severe
blocking skill, take Rage Yellow. Besides that, they actually have a bit of
speed and punch.


                               ----Redaped----
                                   -------

Redapeds are awkward on land, and kind of unwieldily at first, but their jumping
skill is unmatched. The PaleDark and Rage forms are a lot more stable than the
others, and quicker. Though while Dark kind of bounces along, they're still
decent combatants and you should give them a chance.

Redapeds are great at jumping over enemies or attacks. But don't get too cocky
because they generally can't take a hit.

The trickiest thing about Redapeds is contacting an enemy. They are extremely
floaty. So you have to learn the distance your form needs to strike from. This
is important, so that you start your strike slightly before you would with
another colour. It's kind of hard to hit enemies against walls, but you'll get
used to it.

-==Creating Clash==-
   --------------

Clash 1-Limb - Rage Red from a 1-Limb Clash Redaped.
Clash 2-Limb and higher - combination Rage Red and Rage Blue, at least
                          one of each.

*Pale:
Pale Redapeds are generally pretty weak, and not too mobile unless you jump.
Sort of like Pale Yellow, they're really a shadow of their darker colours.

*PaleDark:
PaleDark are straight forward walkers. Their jumping is kind of erratic, but
they're not terribly powerful. They aren't utterly weak though, so you can do
some fancy evasive tactics. You need to lure enemies away from a group using
one of these.

*Dark:
Dark Redapeds kind of walk by hopping - though this will not cause much of a
problem. I still recommend you lure enemies out of groups but this form is
starting to get strong enough to compete.

*Clash:
Clash Redapeds are kind of like Redapeds mixed with Bluocytes. With a B level
Pounce, they can be decent snipers + evasion artists. It's a tough mix to
master, as the Clash Reds also sidewind, but could be useful if you wanted a
stronger sidewinder.

*Rage:
Rage Reds are the most stable of the Redapeds, possessing high defense and
decent attack, not to mention easy to control motion. This will probably be the
red of choice if you don't take to the tricky Clash.

                               ----Bluocytes----
                                   --------

Bluocytes are a low defense type if Cubivore, many of them possessing a
sidewinding form of movement. But they're an artisan's cubivore, and can be
excellent if mastered. Bluocytes have huge pounce ratings, and that makes them
the snipers of the Cubivore world.

If you can master the awkward, often slow movement, and judge the pouncing
distances, Bluocytes can take on many comers, especially the amazing Rage
Bluocytes.

You still need to take individuals out of groups with most Bluocytes. They will
take a serious pounding if they get caught in the middle of a couple of
enemies. But if you dodge an enemy's attack, chances are you'll be able to make
up the distance between it and yourself with a pounce.

-==Creating Clash==-
   --------------

Clash 1-Limb - Rage Blue from a 1-Limb Clash Bluocytes.
Clash 2-Limb - Rage Blue, and Rage Yellow.
Clash 3-Limb and higher - Combination of Rage Blue, Rage Yellow, and Rage
                          Purple with at least one of each.


*Pale:
These frog cubivores are pretty slow, and light on defense. While they do get a
decent Pounce rating, they're tough to manage in a brawl.

*PaleDark:
With the sidewinding snakes, you have to strafe your enemy. The raw claw really
helps as you can move past, facing the enemy, and pounce. These guys aren't too
quick though, so use caution.

*Dark:
Another sidewinding Blue, but better than Paledark. Essentially, use the same
tactics.

*Clash:
A decently strong morph, Clash Bluocytes move straight forward. So, if you want
the distance, without the odd motion, this may be a good beast to check out.

*Rage:
The 6-Limb Blue Rage is amazing, and the whole group is pretty good. They move
sideways, but they're actually pretty quick, and have amazing distance with
decent power. Reverse will make them walk sideways. Rage Blue is my Blue of
choice, and if you haven't taken to this colour yet, this may turn the tide.

                               ----Purpial----
                                   -------

Purpial are great beasts, because they're quite mobile. While their attack is
low, as is defense really, they have decent forward speed and simply amazing
reverse speed.

This lets you quickly get out of scrapes that would be otherwise foolish for
other similarly physically lacking forms to attempt. That's not to say Purpials
are really "weak," but until you hit dark they're great at evasion but less so
at dealing damage.

You really need to use reverse in combat with Purpials. This has a huge
advantage - you will still be facing the enemy if it attacks and you dodge, and
with the Raw Claw, you can make rapid strikes like this.

-==Creating Clash==-
   --------------

Clash 1-Limb - Rage Purple from a 1-Limb Clash Purpial.
Clash 2-Limb and Higher - combination of Rage Purple and Rage Grey with at
                          least one of each.

*Pale:
Pale are decent in the beginning of the game, not so much against bosses. They
are decently quick, having dedicated legs.

*PaleDark:
PaleDark are desirable because they are similar to pale, but stronger. They
have the same quick movement, and the same benefits but stronger.

*Dark:
Purpials are really a simple beast for the most part because they're really
easy to use. If you know how to use Pale and PaleDark, you won't have any
issues except better performance.

*Clash:
Again, these are quite similar to what you've experienced before, except
superior reverse speed.

*Rage:
Something different! Backwards for a Rage Purpial is its normal forward. That
is, the head faces backwards. This means you have a constant dash in effect,
and while not as strong as a Greyodon dash, you won't get fatigued. The forward
dash isn't _too_ slow, so you can escape danger by backing up if it gets too
intense. Might be a hard form to learn, because you're reversed.


                              ----Greyodon----
                                  --------

Greyodons are the attacking titans of the Cubivore kingdom, they are the beasts
with the most severe attack power and the greatest dash speed. If you're new to
Cubivore, you'll want a few Greyodons as EZ Mutates. And even if you aren't,
you probably still will.

The high speed dash lets you take control of groups of enemies, dash away and
dodge attacks or dash up to an enemy that just missed you. Besides this, your
stomach and physical qualities are very high.

The only drawback to Greyodons is that there really aren't any gimmicks here,
but then they don't really need them.

-==Creating Clash==-
   --------------

Clash 1-Limb - Rage Grey from a 1-Limb Clash Greyodon.
Clash 2-Limb - Rage Grey and Rage Yellow.
Clash 3-Limb - Rage Grey, Rage Yellow, and Rage Red.
Clash 4-Limb - Rage Grey, Rage Yellow, Rage Red, and Rage Blue.
Clash 5-Limb - Rage Grey, Rage Yellow, Rage Red, Rage Blue, and Rage Purple.
Clash 6-Limb - Rage Grey, Rage Yellow, Rage Red, Rage Blue, and Rage Purple as
               well as one Rage meat of any colour.

*Pale:
Pale are quick, and strong compared to other Pales. You'll want to use them
where you can early in the game, but switch to Paledark ASAP.

*PaleDark:
Definitely an improvement, and they pass the test for quite some time until the
late-mid game.

*Dark:
Always useful if you can't get Rage, Dark Greyodons will become common enemies.
High strength and speed.

*Clash:
Clash are powerful, but the complex colour combinations makes them at times a
little less practical than some people may want to bother with.

*Rage:
Extremely powerful. If you get the 6-Limb Rage Greyodon as an EZ Mutate, you
are set.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

The many methods by which you power-up your cubivore.

                                CV4.1: Bits
                               -------------

*Lovebits:

Collect these bits to increase your potency at the mating grounds. 100 lovebits
means every female you mate with will give birth.

*Scar Bit, Horn Bit, Hump Bit:

Collect these to gain points to your Scar, Hump, and Horn. Each gives 1 point.


                                CV4.2: Bugs
                               -------------

*Green Vegetabug:

Eat these guys to restore some of your hitpoints.

*Lovebug:

Eat this to increase your lovebits. They are worth 3 lovebits. They will run
away if you aren't fast.

*Red Vegetabug:

They also heal you, like the green guys, but they will attack you. They only do
minimal damage, but they can be annoying if you don't deal with them.

*Wildabug:

Eat these to restore wilderness to white areas. A message will show how many
more you need.

                             CV4.3: Raw Meet
                            -----------------

*Raw-Bone:

Increases the potency of your blocking skill.

*Raw-Claw:

This lets you lock-on to pounce while you run. Extremely useful.

*Raw-Life:

This lets you mate with the Ulti-Mate Female.

*Raw-Paw:

This lets you dash by holding in R when you move.

*Raw-Peeper:

Your abilities are ingrained. That is, if you get a raw-meat eaten, you keep
its power.

*Raw-Shnoz:

Stay perfectly still for a few seconds and you will be camouflaged. It fools
most, but not all enemies.

*Raw-Wilderness:

No effect, it's something to collect in a specific area.

                               CV4.4: Training
                              -----------------

*Bullfrogstool:

Pounce to grab, then hold X to stretch back. Let go when you are 3 red bars
away (the red bars at the top). Trains Tongue.

*Rampage Bowl:

Spin around in this bowl to increase your scar points.

*Toadstool:

Only appears once, pounce and pull to train your tongue.

*Treadmill:

Run on this to increase your hump points.

*Wooden Horse:

Pounce at this to increase your horn points.

                               CV4.5: Other
                              --------------

*Herbibeast:

Eat these guys to restore a large amount of life.

*Rejuvinator:

Use a rejuvinator by pausing and hitting Z. Restores all your life. Use only if
completely necessary.

*Seed of Fright:

Lets you roar by pressing Y.

*Slot Token:

Your colours shift colour, try to stop them on specific colours to get a
mutation. Note that you can change COLOUR but not TYPE. Rage meat is always
rage meat, pale is always pale.

*Snack Grass:

Eat some to restore HP.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

This walkthrough for Cubivore has a number of considerations. For one, it is
geared towards getting you more than 100 Mutations before the end of the last
stage. For another, it's also about maximizing potential in this last area.

While this method works well, you will want to cut some corners for the forms
you want. I will have you get a powerful Cubivore for your 100th, and an easy
mutate but as always you can experiment as you please.

It shouldn't take too much alteration to make it fit your playing style.
Remember, you get EZ mutates at 20, 50, 80, and 100 Mutations and everytime you
mate so you should focus on either what you _Can't_ get in the next stage or
what would be most _useful_.

There are many "bits" that increase stats in this game, I will not be
concentrating on them in this walkthrough. They're in the fields and tall grass
so they aren't difficult to find. While I WILL direct you to them in general,
they don't warrant an exhaustive section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               CV5.1: Paw Dunes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your piggy will be born, and it's time to get started. Paw Dunes is a very
simple, tutorial style stage. You really just have to follow the path through
the level, though there are some things to look out for.

You can start by eating some of the brownish grass up ahead, Snack Grass. This
will refill your stomach meter, your hit points.

You can follow along the path here to find a Vegetabug - they need to be
pounced on. Get close, hold L, and hit A to pounce. This will be used in
fighting other Cubivores. Keep on the path until you reach the Training Horse,
which you need to pounce on for a while to increase your horn meter.

Lovebits along the path now, eat them. Collect lovebits for greater success in
mating - ie get 100 and all the females you mate with will bear young. There
is more training up ahead, toadstools. They are only found here. Jump at them
and hold the control stick to increase Tongue points.

Further up the path is a 1-Limb Pale Yellowbrate, a Tirejack. Let's start
mutating. When you glow, he is going to attack you, get out of the way then
pounce on him. When his stomach reaches 0, pounce and grab his meat like the
toadstools. Tear it off and eat it to assume his form.

Do this again to the 1-Limb Pale Red you meet, Hanky. After this there is a
Pale Purpial to eat, Eject. Eat them up, and experiment with the different
colour forms.

When you see the creature with dark meat, Scarf, make sure you stay a distance
away, and dodge him with a little jump when he pounces. This will get you
prepared for bosses that you will eventually fight. Pounce on him then take his
meat to become the PaleDark Yellowbrate, Scarf.

Now, there's a door here. Check the hedge walls straight across from the door
to find a secret passage. there's a PaleDark Purpial in here, kill and snack.
Take nay lovebits and head on out through the door.

Progress Report-
5 Mutations:
**1-Limb Pale Yellow: Tirejack
**1-Limb PaleDark Yellow: Scarf
**1-Limb Pale Red: Hanky
**1-Limb Pale Purple: Eject
**1-Limb PaleDark Purpial: Stocking

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       CV5.2: Bleach White Highlands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just head along the path and you will eventually come to a white area. There is
a little silver bug wandering nearby. This is a Wildabug, eating it will
restore some of the whited-out Wilderness to its former glory. Snack it up.

There's a rejuvinator, a healing item you can use by pressing Z on the pause
screen and a horn bit along the path. Head toward the grass box. Pounce it to
reveal a seed of fright, which lets you let out an intimidating roar.

Follow this up by first eating any lovebits in the grass and then the two
wildabugs. Another path will be created.

There's a two-limbed Pale Bluocytes here, skip it for now and any bits along the
way. You won't get enough for an upgrade now anyways. Eat the wildabug you see
along the way, and make sure you loose the Bluocytes.

When you see the boss, Cubscout Beast, lure one of his greyodon buddies over to
you. Get closer and closer until one takes notice but the others don't. Slay
and eat it. Now, as a Greyodon, lure over the other greyodon. Eat him and
finally lure over the cubscout. Jump out of the way when he pounces - you may
want to keep him around the wall so you don't have to chase him all over.

The Cubscout boss gives you the Raw Paw, which lets you dash with the R button
for short distances - an excellent upgrade and one you will come to value.

Now, head back tot he two-limbed Bluocytes, and kill it. eat some of his meat to
become a 1-Limbed Pale Bluocytes. After this, collect any bits you passed and go
on to the next area.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               CV5.3: Frog Bog
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frog Bog is where it starts to get a little more serious. The boss is strong
in comparison to our little Piggy, and it's a bit longer. However, we also get
to mate - meaning you will have a two limb creature and the chance to get some
strong mutations.

So, when the stage begins, search around the love door, in the corners in the
flowers off to the distance and around the back of the hut. Kill the Pale
Bluocytes (1-limb) here for the experience and then eat the PaleDark Redaped.
This will turn you into Squirtgun, a 1-limbed PaleDark Redaped.

Now, head into the Mating Grounds, you should be able to attract 3 females by
now. The form to choose is the Pale Yellowbrate called Pedal. This choice is
important because you cannot get one in this round, and you'll be getting
better forms soon anyways.

Head behind the love hut and eat the wildabugs here to make a path of
wilderness. Head on through the path, make sure to pick up the hump bit and go
for the Oasis. There are horn and love bits here, collect them up. From the
Oasis look for the Pale Redapeds. Eat both of them to get a 2-limbed pale red,
Pennant.

From here, look for a wildabug - it should be nearby. You'll spot a lovebit
trail - follow it to the bowl. Roll in the bowl to train your scar points. When
you exit the Training Grounds, take a right to find a wildabug and a bit. Snack
them and look at the Purpials nearby.

These are two Pale Purpials, kill and eat them to take on a Pale Purpial form
yourself, the two-limbed Play. Keep casing the perimeter of this area. You
should see a short cinema about Herbibeasts. But don't linger because there are
greyodons near the herbibeasts.

Instead, head straight across from where the Purpials were, you will find two
PaleDark Yellowbrates. Be very careful, and take these on one at a time. When
you eat them, you should take on the two-limbed PaleDark Yellow form, Bandanna.

Turn and continue down the way. There should be at least two wildabugs, one
after the Yellowbrates and one nearer to the Bluocytes. The two Bluocytes are
Pale, which is why we could eat the little guy at the start of the level. Eat
both of them to become the two-limbed Bluocytes, Maraca.

Head to the Oasis with the Greyodons and Herbibeasts. There are two pale Greys
here, take out the two-limbed first. Eating both of them will make you a Pale
2-Limbed Greyodon. After eating them, look around the Oasis for some bits and
the final wildabugs.

As you approach the boss, take the horn and hump bits, as well as the
rejuvinator, but leave the snack grass. The Boyscout beast is a three-limbed
Pale Bluocytes, so it is a frog. His partners are two limbed pale bluocytes.

It is essential that you take out his cronies first. Dodge them and strike,
they will sink into the bog and retreat. This pattern makes them take longer
than they should but if you are patient and don't get ganged up on, you should
be able to hold out. Eat snack grass if you take a hit, and if you have to use
the Oasis make sure you loose the boss first.

Fight the Boss closer to a wall. It is a Bluocytes so it has a really long
bounce. This means that you will probably be out of range after dodging him,
and he will move again before you can get to him. If he hits a wall, you can
lay into him from a shorter distance. If he is facing the wall, get in three or
four hits before he turns around, then get to safety.

When you beat him, you'll get the Raw Bone which increases your blocking
ability. Look around his lair for some bits before exiting through the door.

                             CV5.4: Mupopo Desert
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explore the area collecting love bits and the love bugs, as well as the
rejuvinator. Then get to the mating grounds. We'll be choosing a 3-Limbed Pale
Yellowbrate. Yes, this is not a great form, but we will geta  decent beast for
our 20 mutations. It's best to snack up Cranky in the mating grounds because
you'd have trouble getting one in this level.

Anyways, after mating kill the Redapeds to the left of the mating grounds and
eat them, gaining the PaleDark Musket. This for, at least, will be more useful
than the Yellowbrate.

Take the right path, practice on the training post (for tongue) and then find
and eat the Wildabug near the bleached area to reveal a path.

Kill the red vegetabugs, they're annoying and can do a little damage to you.
Look for some horn and scar bits on route. Look around the Yellowbrates for
some bits but do not kill them yet.

When you see all of the colours of cubivores behind the white area, a boss is
near. There are three wildabugs near the boss. Run in and out of there
collecting them but do not kill the boss or any of its cronies. We'll need them
for our EZ mutate for 20 mutations, and if you kill the boss the stage ends.

So without any foolish risks, get all of the wildabugs and retreat. When you
come back, go to the Oasis. Look for the pale redapeds first, eat them to
become a 3-limbed Pale Redaped, Banner.

Now, you should have 17 mutations. Look for the Pale Purpials. Eat enough to
become a Pale Purpial, Rewind, and then kill the rest for stomach experience.

Now you should have 18 mutations. Find the Pale Greyodons, NOT the ones near
the boss yet as they are PaleDark. Anyways, eat two to become a Pale Greyodon,
Dreadlock. Your next mutation will be an EZ mutate, as you now have 19 total.
Let's make it something workable...

Draw one of the bosses cronies over to you, these are PaleDark Greyodons. With
the meat you got becoming Dreadlock, you will become a PaleDark when you swill
some of their dark meat. This will make the 3-Limbed PaleDark Greyodon, Folder,
will be an EZ mutate.

Great, run from the boss. Find the four Bluocytes. Eat the Pales first to take
on the Pale form, Bongo. Now eat the PaleDark form for the PaleDark Ottoman.

Now, there's a 3-Limbed PaleDark Yellowbrate around here, eat him and get some
of the dark meat. Return to the Yellowbrates you passed, eat them, and you
should take on the PaleDark form Collar.

Let's return to the Oasis. You're a PaleDark right now. There's a path near the
Oasis that leads to a slot token, which you can try to use to geta  PaleDark
Purpial or Redaped I suppose. This guide doesn't take slot tokens into account
on the first run through. That's asking a little much of you to reset if you
don't get the right colour...

Anyways, after that look around the stage for any bits you may have missed.
When you're confident you've been thorough, it's time for the boss. Change into
Folder and take out any of his cronies that may be left for the experience.

The boss is a Greyodon, so he's pretty quick and strong. As always, keep him
near a wall so you can get a couple of quick hits in on him. You need the
wall to cut his jump short because you can't pounce while running yet.

Do NOT fight him with the others around him. You may be PaleDark Grey, but that
simple fact won't save you here.

He has the Raw-Life, which let's you mate with the Ulti-Mate Female. The stage
will end as soon as you eat this chunk of meat.

When you get to Rainbow Heaven, simply follow the path that is laid out for you
and listen to the information the game gives you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV5.6: Paw Rainforest
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, you're reborn as a Grizzly, with 1-limb again. Whatever form you are
born with is an EZ mutate for when you have 1 limb. From being born, head for
the log blockade for the love bits and hump bit so you'll grow a bit along the
way.

Now, head the other way. You'll find some pigs you can eat for Experience, you
already have all the forms. These pigs won't attack you, so you can pick a form
you like. Pale Yellow, Red, Blue, and Purple should be here.

There'll be a training bowl, roll in it until it is finished. Follow the horn
and love bits after this to find a dark Yellowbrate. You'll likely encounter a
PaleDark Yellow and Pale Grey before reaching the dark yellow. Pick a form,
then combat the Dark Yellowbrate, eat him to become a Diskbrake.

There will be a Dark Blue 1-limb close by, kill and eat him to become a Hyphen,
1-limb Dark Blue. From here, locate the Oasis. Nearby is the boss. Lure out his
buddies one at a time. Dodge and pounce, dodge and pounce. Your Hyphen form has
terrific range so it shouldn't be too bad.

When you're ready for the Headcoach Beast, combat him the same way. You have a
very long pounce so if you can get him to pounce at a wall, you'll most likely
reach him with your pounce. As always, get a few bites on him while his back is
turned, then run to another wall as he's much faster than you.

Once it's defeated, you get the Raw-Paw again. Look around for any bits you may
have missed, then move away from the door. There is a secret passage across
from it, wherein you will find some love bits, a rejuvinator, and a 1-limbed
dark Purpial, Puberty.

                         CV5.7: Whitestill Highlands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are more or less forced to mate. You will most likely have every form here
except Beebee, which you can get in this stage anyways. But still, it's
probably the best form available so take it.

Onto the stage, you can eat all Pale beasts in this area except the Purpials.
You have all the forms here, but save the Purpials for later. Anyways, get the
horn bit then head up toward the red area. Eat a wildabug here, then venture as
far into the wilderness as you can. Get the hump bit, then look for the next
two wildabugs. Collect the bits and rejuvinator, then enter the door.

Lots of colour here, and there's a method to the madness. Eat the PaleDark
2-Limbed Red for Dark Meat (make sure you get the dark meat, not pale) and then
the 1-Limbed Dark Red for the 2-Limbed Dark Red form, Bevel. If you did not get
Beebee yet, eat the other PaleDark red and make sure you get Pale meat. However
it is wise to save the PaleDark Red and the 2-Limbed Red for when you gain your
3-Limbed Grizzly.

Head to the Oasis, eat the PaleDark Purpial for Dark Meat (make sure you get
dark meat) and then the 2-limbed Dark Purpial for the 2-limbed dark purple form
Adolescense. Eat the other PaleDark for the other PaleDark form, Pants.

Return to the big group and eat the two Bluocytes to achieve the 2-limbed
PaleDark form Armrest. Eat the Paledark Yellows, but leave the Reds. Get the
2-Limbed Dark Yellowbrate Calliper.

Now, head to the training grounds and use the treadmill until it changes
colour, this trains your hump points.

It's time to fight the CEO Beast. He's a Dark Greyodon, but pretty much the
same as you've been fighting. You can probably lure him to you without his
troops. The Calliper form, if you're using it, is awkward so practice with it
first. As always, try to make him pounce at a wall. When you kill him, you get
the Raw-Claw, which lets you pounce while running. Extremely useful. Kill his
cronies immediately, if you haven't already.

Head toward the white patch near the Training Grounds. Eat a wildabug and run.
A lot of Dark Blues will emerge. Pick two of them off, to assume a 2-Limbed
Dark blue form - Bracket, for yourself. Now, run for your life and mate.

You probably have all of the available forms, so just take what you find most
useful. After you grow, kill off the rest of the Dark Blues. This will land you
the 3-Limbed form, Caret.

Now, head to the Oasis again and eat the Ratchet. Now, eat the 2-Limbed Red for
the 3-Limbed Dark Red form, Ratchet. Eat the First Date, the Dark Purpial, then
return to the first screen and eat the pale Purpials for the Paledark form
Apron, a 3-limbed Purpial.

Now, there's a boss near the remaining white area - the Parental Advisory
Beast. Lure out his Dark Greyodon cohorts and eat both of them to take on the
Scentaur form. Now, you can attack the Parental Advisory Beast. Handle him the
same way as you did the CEO. Dodge and pounce, dodge and pounce. You'll get the
Raw-Bone again when all is said and done.

Search around now for the slot token and any bits. You can get another form
from the slot but this is not counted in the guide.

Leave through the bush to enter another area. Eat the lovebits and exit through
the next door. Eat the lovebugs and bits and leave the stage through the leaf
door.

                              CV5.8: Lake Getum
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll notice a boss here right away, the Guardsman Beast. This is a Herbibeast
but you shouldn't go after him just yet. Head left when you reach the river to
find a horn bit.

In the field near the Guardsman there should be Dark Yellow and Pale Blue. Eat
the Dark Yellows to become a 3-Limbed Dark Yellowbrate, Fenderbender, and then
head into the mating grounds. You will be able to get every form here, so I
suggest you take any available Greyodons, like Afro. This will help immensely
in the special stage.

When you exit, kill the Guardsman Beast. Again, he is a herbibeast and you can
pretty much chase him while nipping at his heels. He'll give you 1/4 of the
Raw-Shnoz. You can eat the Pale Blues around here for the Tuningfork form.
Look around for a Lovebit Trail and follow it.

You'll come to a glowing area, eat the 2-Limbed Pale Yellow completely before
you enter and then jump on the portal to go to the special stage.

******************************************************************************
                            Snake in the Grassland

The first special stage you will enter is 7 minutes long. There's a definite
pattern you should follow here. When I say a direction like north, consider the
flashing red square as magnetic north for the purposes of this guide.

You have to move fast to get all of the Mutations here, which is why a Greyodon
is so useful. Check the patches of grass to find cubivores.

*Yellowbrates:
Head east and find the Cranky. Since you already have Pale Yellow Meat, you can
slay and eat this for the 4-Limbed Pale Yellow Form. Now, head to the west side
of the area and look for a Fenderbender. Eat it for the PaleDark yellow 4-limb.
There is another Yellowbrate nearby, another dark. Eat this Fenderbender to
take on the 4-Limbed dark form. Check tot he northwest of the first
Fenderbender for the second.

*Bluocytes:
Next we'll do Blue. Head south and eat the Dark Blue you'll find. Search south
of it to locate another, taking on the 4-Limbed Dark Blue form, Ditto. Head
south again and eat the two Bongos, Pale Bluocytes. They are both very close to
one another and eating them will in sequence give you the 4-Limbed PaleDark
Blue: Recliner, and the 4-Limbed Pale Blue: Tuning Fork. That is, unless you
already got it outside.

*Purpial:
Head to the Oasis in the north then head north to find a Pale Purpial. There
are two around here so look carefully and quickly. Eat both for the 4-Limbed
Pale Purpial form, Pause. Now, head north. To the west and east of the portal
there should be Dark Purpials. Eat them both to get a 4-Limb PaleDark: Kimono,
and a 4-Limb Dark: Bigdate.

*Redaped:
Reds are the simplest here. Head east, find the reds, and eat them for the Dark
4-Limb form, Router.

*Greyodon:
If you have time, there are Greyodons near the portal. They are PaleDark, and
if you can get that as your 50th mutation, that would help. But it isn't really
necessary. You can get the Greys outside of the special stage.
******************************************************************************

Head to the lake, take both entrances to get all the bits. The Neighbourhood
Watch Beast is here. Eat him to get the next piece of Shnoz, he's easy to beat
as he just retreats and blocks. When he is dead, a door will open up, do not
enter yet.

Search the Lake area for bits, then turn your attention to the Reds. Eat the
Pales to get the 4-Limb Pale Red form, Halfmast, then eat the PaleDark form to
get its Dark meat, making you the form Derringer. Train on the Wooden Horse,
then leave through the door that opened.

Through here, there are Greyodons. Eat the PaleDarks, then the Pales to get
both forms, Notebook and Afro. Search every bit of snack grass in these fields
as bits (upgrade and love) rest beside many of them. Search all along the edge
of the white area, as well.

When you reach the Vigilance Beast, gobble up some Lovebugs. Then train your
sights on the Vigilance beast. It will not attack you, so just antagonize it
until it falls. When you eat it, some wilderness will open up.

The Health Inspector Beast is here with a pack of aggressive Herbibeasts. Lure
them out a few at a time and keep killing them until you find the real boss.
He'll be easy to kill and eat when you find him, then you will have the full
Raw-Shnoz. If you stay still for a few seconds, you will camouflage. This is
extremely useful in the next stage.

You can leave the stage when you have this raw meat.

                              CV5.9: Ultimarsh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The boss and cohorts here are the strongest you've encountered yet. Make SURE
to use the Raw-Shnoz's camouflage ability before you move around. The District
Attorney and his two 6-Limbed dark Grey partners constantly patrol the stage.
You'll often need to wait for them to leave an area.

But first, if you hope to even damage them, you'll need 5 limbs. Go mate. You
should have more than 100 love bits, so take the Dark Yellowbrate. It is the
only form that is totally unavailable in this stage.

Camouflage, make your way to the door, and train on the Wooden Horse.

Let's mutate before we fight the boss. As I said, camouflage before moving.

Bluocytes:
When you find the Bluocytes, pick either the Pale or Dark forms, probably the
Dark. Pick them off one at a time, run and camouflage between each one. You will
eat the second group after the first, and this will allow you to take on the
forms 5-Limbed Pale Blue: Triangle, PaleDark: SleepingBag, and Dark: Tilde.

Purpial:
Eat the two Pale Purpials near the Bluocytes to take on the 5-Limbed Pale form
Speeddub. Camouflage and sneak around to find a Dark Purpial near the Yellows
and another near the Paledark reds. Eating both will land you the PaleDark form
Kimono, then the Dark Form Honeymoon.

Yellowbrate:
Find them, eat the Dark form, then the two Pales. This should land you with the
PaleDark form Bowtie, and the Pale form Forklift.

Redaped:
Eat a PaleDark Redaped, then based on which colours you get, eat another Red.
With two colours in a row, isolate them and eat the appropriate Red to take on
that form. If the meats are mixed up, then eat the other PaleDark Red to take
on the PaleDark form, hopefully getting two meats of the same colour in a row
with him. AT LEAST get two forms out of this.

Greyodon:
Get Pale Meat from one of the PaleDarks. Keep trying them until you have pale
meat in your mouth. As long as you have two Pale meats, isolated, you're good
to go. There should be a Pale Greyodon nearby. Eat it to take on the Toupee
pale form. Now, go eat a PaleDark Greyodon. Get Dark Meat, keep latching on
until you have some in your jaws, this will land you the PaleDark form Binder.

Okay, now comes the hard part, Dark Grey. If you have two Dark Greys in a row
from the PaleDark form, isolate them (poop any pale grey to the left of them)
and get ready to rumble. Please note that the Scenturions are extremely
powerful, and the District Attorney is just a stronger version of them. You need
to lure one over to you, there is NO question about this. If not, they will
knock you senseless and steal your raw meat.

You may want to sneak up, camouflaged, hit a Scenturion and run for your life.
If you get one alone, pound on it until the others come, then run away. Heal,
camouflage, and repeat. When both are dead and you're a 5-Limbed Dark Greyodon,
you can search around the stage for any bits you might have missed.

When the time comes to kick the District Attorney's ass, you will want to use
the same strategy. Camouflage, hit, run, repeat. NEVER draw him to the Oasis.
When he is killed, you get the Raw-Life, and a chance to mate with the
Ulti-Mate Female again.

*If the District attorney hits you, run away as he will do over 100 damage,
more than likely.

Heaven. This will introduce Rage and Clash beasts to you. These are very strong
colours.

See either the Colours section or the Stats section for information on making
Clash forms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV5.11: Paw Pasture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You're reborn once more as a single-limbed creature. From both sides of your
nest are passages. Check out each one for love bits, they lead to the same
place anyways. Your first order of business is to head to the training grounds
and train your tongue.

There are piggies and grizzlies, they all have forms you've seen before. Eat
them. Head to the Oasis, and collect the lovebits. Eat one of the Scenters here
to get a 1-limbed Dark Grey form, Scenty. Now, head around the map to the
north end of the stage. There's another Oasis up here.

To the west of this Oasis is a secret passage, with 3 scenters and a
Closeknees. Lure the Scenters out one at a time and eat all three. Then, eat
the Closeknees, the 1-limbed Rage Yellowbrate. This is the form you will use to
fight the Shoplifting Cubivore.

The Shoplifter has a roll attack, which you should run from, but a dodge and
strike strategy works very well here, especially when you are Rage Yellow. You
will down him within a few hits, eat his Raw Paw and you're good to go.

We're not mating yet, however. Eat one, and only one, of the Clash Yellows
nearby to get the 1-limbed Footrace form. Then, head to the North Oasis and eat
the Stapler here, for the 1-limbed PaleDark Grey form, Stickypad. One more for
now. Find the 2-Limbed Dark Redaped, Bevel, and eat it to get the 1-limbed Dark
red form, Jigbit.

Time to Mate. Head through the door to the west for a Training horse. Head then
to the first Oasis, eat the Buzzcut, then the Scenter to get the 2-limbed
Paledark Greyodon, Stapler.

Explore the whole stage now, and eat every Dark Greyodon around to get the
2-limbed dark Greyodon, Scenter. Afterwards, eat the other Clash Yellow
Footrace, and head towards the exit door to fight the Pickpocket Cubivore.

The Pickpocket Cubivore has a spin that will dizzy you, run if this happens as
it will prevent you from attacking. Anyways, he has two Clash Purpials as his
partners. With your Rage Yellow meat, you can get a Clash Greyodon out of this.
Knock out a Purpial and grab its meat, ONLY eat if you get Grey. Rage Grey +
Rage Yellow = Clash Grey, Studio.

Now, attack the Pickpocket Cubivore, dodge and strike. You should take it out
pretty quickly as a Studio. Again, if it dizzies you, run away for a bit. It
holds the Raw Claw, which as you know lets you lock on while moving. Now,
after it is dead, attack the other Clash Purpial. Take its purple meat, let go
if it gives you grey. Rage Grey + Rage Purpial = Clash Purpial, Cleaner.

Now, eat any other for experience and search the stage for bits. Then leave.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        CV5.12: Verdigrass Highlands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grab the Lovebit and mate, take the Dark Purpial form Firstdate. Eat the Pigs
and Bears but save the Clash Purpial. Knock over the grass container to reveal
a 1-limbed Clash Red, do not eat it yet.

Enter the next area, I'll call it Section 2, and use the rampage Bowl. There's
another door here that leads to Section 3 (and Section 3 leads to Section 1).
We'll complete a full lap of the stage before we start mutating. Head into
Section 3 and eat the Wildabugs. You'll have to cross the treadmill to find one
of them. There should be Dark Purpials nearby, but we already took care of that
mutation with mating. If not, do so. There's a rejuvinator nearby.

Check the Oasis for bits, and run form any Beastructions. There is a room with
two Beastructions, it is very small and also has eight Wildabugs. Lure at least
one of the Beastructions out, then eat the wildabugs. While you're eating you
can avoid damage, but if you get hit - heal. No chances here.

Enter the door, eat all the Wildabugs in the next room, then let's get started.
There are three Prospectors, two in Section 1 and one in section 2 (it's in
the corner across the map from the door to Section 3. This combination will
lead to the 3-limbed Rage Bluocytes, Electricfan.

Alright, eat the Clash Blue in Section 3 and make SURE you get Rage Yellow. Eat
the Clash Purpial Rag we skipped for Clash Blue: Bellhop. Now, poop out the
purple and yellow meats. Head to section 2 and eat a Spur for a 3-Limbed Clash
Redaped: Linedance.

Get the Red alone. Poop any Blue that you can, you need 2 Rage Red in a row.
Now, go on into Section 3. Eat the Howdy here for a 3-Limbed Rage Redaped:
Violin. There's a Shotput in Section 3 that you can eat to get a 3-Limbed Clash
Yellowbrate: Dumbell.

You should have Rage Yellow and Rage Red. Return to section 1 and eat the
Freeloader for the 3-Limbed Clash Greyodon, Cottage. Rage Yellow + Rage Red +
Rage Grey = Clash Grey.

Now, finally, eta the Clash Purpial in Section 2 for a 3-limbed Clash Purpial,
Broom. Search for any bits, then leave.

83 Mutations, 8 New:

***3-Limbed Clash Yellowbrate: Dumbell
***3-Limbed Clash Redaped: Linedance

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV5.13: Killing Plains
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the information on Diet Plan, we won't be using it right away. Eat the
Clash Yellow to get your Clash Grey form again. Find the Purse Snatcher boss
right from the start. He's strong and there's a lot around him, but a hit and
run tactic will suffice. When it goes up high, extending its legs, you can't
hurt it. It drops the Raw Bone.

It's time to mate. Either take Clash Blue or Dark Grey, though Clash Blue is
more difficult to achieve than Dark Grey. Clash Blue is a terrific group, to
boot...

Either way, avoid the Conman Beast and get to mutating. Look for the field of
Lovebits. It is also full of Dark Greyodons. Stay near the door and eat them
all. This will land you the Scentsless form if you didn't get it form mating.

You can attack the Clash Purpials, the Toothbrushes and eat specifically their
purple parts. The Rage Purpial form, Kneel is difficult to get from them, but
keep trying from where you mated. Go back to the start of the level now and eat
the Clash Purpial for Clash Purpial 4-limbed: Duster.

Now, for the Porter. To get this Clash Bluocytes, poop out the Rage Grey and eat
the Clash Bluocytes.

You can try for Rage Red and Rage Yellow, but after Rage Purpial this is
something of an aggravation. I'd instead suggest you now eat the Clash Reds for
the Clash Red form: Stirrup. Then, poop out the blue and eat Clash Yellows for
the Clash Yellow form: Sumo.

Time to kill the Conman. A hit and run tactic is definitely needed here. His
roar actually causes damage and he can spin to make you dizzy. Hit him and
take off. Clash Blue works well here because of the extra pounce range. Let's
you take on the roar a little more safely. He'll give the Raw Shnoz.

Find the rejuvinator and bits in the stage, then leave.

89 Mutations, 6 New:

***4-Limbed Clash Yellowbrate: Sumo
***4-Limbed Clash Redaped: Stirrup
***4-Limbed Clash Bluocytes: Porter (One of the better mating choices)
***4-Limbed Clash Purpial: Duster
***4-Limbed Rage Purpial: Kneel
***4-Limbed Dark Greyodon: Scentsless (One of the better mating choices)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV5.14: Venery Beach
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Venery Beach has a very definite way to go about it. Many of the cubivores will
flee after a short time, so you may reset once or twice. But it's worth it. You
want to end this level with close to, but not more than, 97 mutations. This
lets you pick a 100th mutation EZ-mutate in the next stage.

Before you mate, get the rejuvinator and bit behind you. When you do mate,
choose the Clash Bluocytes. This will save you a lot of trouble.

Grow to max size then eat the rage Yellow here, leave the other colours. Make
sure you only have one block of yellow. Eat the Rage Red that appears as you
continue on, again poop so you only have one block of red and one block of
yellow. Keep going through the water and eat the rag that appears for a block
of Rage Purple. There's a Rage Blue a little further ahead. Eat this and poop
one of the Blues.

Backtrack a little, and go up the hill. Take a right, don't go up into the
green section. Eat a Freeloader when you find them and you'll get hooked up
with Clash Grey, Evicted.

Now, eat the Rag (Purpial) and go down off the hill. Eat the Rage Purpial to
get Clash Purpial, Toothbrush. Don't go any farther toward the exit, instead
enter the special stage in the water.

******************************************************************************
                               Buffet Clearing

You have 10 minutes, but you should get through this area much more quickly
than that.

*Purpials:
Head east, eat the Rage Purpial for Rage Purpial: Yoga. This should be easy
enough as your Rage Grey meat should be near the far right of your meats and
you picked up a lot of Purpial for the Toothbrush.

*Redapeds:
To the West is a Rage Redaped, get 3 of these tiles. Find and eat a Rage
Bluocytes for the Clash Redaped: Lasso. We won't bother with Clash Blue since
that was out mating mutation.

*Yellowbrates:
Poop out your rage Blue tiles and eat the Rage Yellowbrate here to get the
Clash Yellowbrate, Barbell.

*Pale Red:
Eat the two Flaggys in this special stage to add the Pale 5-Limbed Redaped,
Flaggy to your bestiary.

*Greyodons:
Eat the Rage Greyodon in this special stage. Once you have three of his meats,
it's time to leave.

******************************************************************************

Alright, we're almost done but it can still be messed up. When you emerge, head
towards the end of the stage. Some Cubivores will appear and one of them is a
Rage Grey. Eat this beast before it runs off and you'll get a 5-limbed Rage
Greyodon, Chen.

The other guys pounce on you all the while. You have to move in fats and
accurately to get this mutation. Leave once you get it.

***5-Limbed Clash Yellowbrate: Barbell
***5-Limbed Pale Redaped: Flaggy
***5-Limbed Clash Redaped: Lasso
***5-Limbed Clash Bluocytes: Baglady

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           CV5.15: Wildlife Safari
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The big draw of the Wildlife Safari is its Special Stage. You will plan your
100th mutation based on the Special Stage. Either Rage Yellow, Rage Red, Rage
Blue, Rage Purple, or Rage Grey. We'll focus on Rage Grey for the purposes of
the guide. You should not enter the Special Stage with anymore than 99
mutations, and no less than 94.

This is because of the nature of the special stage. You need all of one colour
to enter a section of the stage where the colours are kept. There are Dark
cubivores outside of the sections that you can eat to gain access, so if you
enter with 94 mutations, 5 Dark forms brings you to 99 and then you can get
your 100th. If you enter with colourmeat as your 99th form (say, Paledark Grey)
you can go to that section right away and try for your 100th. So, the whole
thing is to get a good form, and have a plan worked out.

But let's start the stage, shall we? You'll start by fighting the Muscleman
Cubivore. Kill any silver cronies, but don't eat any colourmeats. The boss is
a Clash Purpial, and retreats constantly. Hit and run is the thing to do,
perhaps with the Shnoz's camouflage ability. His Raw-Peeper ingrains your
powers, so you can still use them if they get eaten away on you.

It's time to mate then. Pick the Beastruction, there's no question that it's
the easiest way to get this form and you'll NEED it for the special stage, for
strength and speed. This should be 98 Mutations by my guide.

Head to the centre of the stage and eat the two PaleDark greys for the Paledark
Form, Portfolio. 99 Mutations. Enter the Special Stage.

******************************************************************************
                             Colorful Crossings

You have ten minutes here and you NEED every minute of it. You may have to come
back here more than once (resetting) because the method isn't fool-proof. You
may get a colourmeat where you don't need it. Don't be afraid to reset, your
100th beast _matters_.

Note that there are six 1-limbed Dark Greyodons and 2 3-Limbed Dark forms of
all the other forms. These are generally one on two different platforms near
their section, and if you eat them the section will open. The Dark Greys are on
three different platforms so it does count to come in here as a Greyodon.

Try to understand the layout of the crossings in case you have to reset.

*Greyodons:
Since we are PaleDark Grey, the grey section is open. Let's head there first,
and geta  Rage Grey for our 100th. There is one Cottage, 4 studios, and a lone
Beastruction. Eat the Cottage, and poop out the red and yellow meats. Then, eat
a studio and poop the yellow meat. Repeat until all Studios are gone. You are
advised to leave the section to poop.

When it comes to the Beastruction, we're going to use diet plan. Don't bite
multiple times (don't re-bite) and hold the x button while you hold the stick
to tear the meat. You NEED a Grey tile. Let go until he gives you grey. If you
did this correctly, you'll have the mighty Rage form, Zen.

*Clean-Up:
You'll want to open all the other sections now. This means you will get the six
limbed Dark forms of Red, Blue, Yellow, and Purple.

EZ Mutate to Zen or Beastruction every time you change form in this area so
that you can get around quickly.

*Purpials:
Purpials are your first order of business. Eat the multilimbed Purpials. You
should get the Rage or Clash form, Rage is preferable. If you get clash, get
rid of any Grey tiles you can.

*Bluocytes:
Eat the two-Limbed Clash Bluocytes. This should land you the Clash form, Mover.
Poop the yellow meat, then eat the next two-limbed. Poop yellow again. Eat the
Mover in an attempt to get two blues (make sure you've got blue in your mouth)
and finish it off with the 1-limbed blue to get the Rage beast, Freezer.

*Redapeds:
Eat the Chaps, this should give you Chaps as your clash form. Now, eat a Spurs
and poop the blue. Eat the two Howdys now to take on the Rage Red form Piano.

*Yellowbrates:
Eat the Squats so that you can get the Clash form, Squats. Now, eat the Shotput
and poop out the red. Finally, eat the Footraces to get the Rage Yellow form,
Splits.

*Before Leaving:
Track down and eat at least three dark greyodons. We'll get dark grey when we
leave. If you don't have time, well you've come too far to reset.

******************************************************************************

You're back in the Wildlife Safari, and we aren't done mutating yet. Run on the
treadmill to train your hump then get ready for action.

*Greyodons:
If you picked up the dark grey meats in Colorful Crossing, head to the centre
and eat the Scenturion for the 6-limbed Dark Greyodon, Scenturion.

*Purpial:
Eat a Paledark Purpial. If you get Pale meat, eat the Pale Purpial. If you get
Dark Meat, eat a Dark Purpial. You should get the Pale, PaleDark, and Dark
forms this way.

*Redaped:
Handle the reds the same as Purple. Eat a Paledark. If you get Pale,
eat a Pale Red. If you get Dark, eat a Dark Red. You can get Pale, PaleDark,
and Dark this way.

*Yellowbrates:
Eat the Pale Yellowbrates, then the dark Yellowbrates. This will land you the
the Pale, Dark, and Paledark forms.

*Boss time:
Kill off the Hitman's cohorts, then check around for bits. When it comes to
fighting the Hitman, a camouflage hit and run tactic is best. When you take the
Raw-Life from him, the stage is over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV5.16: Bosses Galore
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you became King of more than 100 Cubivores, then you will get to enter this
area, which has every boss from the game.

Individually, they are cake. The game put you into your strongest form, which
for us is likely Zen. If you go into the middle, they will still beat on you
pretty thusly though.

As they die, some more seem to appear. Please note that many of the bosses have
more power now too.

Start the match by getting rejuvinator. There's another on the far end of the
stage. Use camouflage to run in and attack one of the dudes on the perimeter.
Hitman and Conman are both good targets. Hitman to remove the biggest threat,
and Conman to get rid of the roar attack.

You want to lure a boss out after you and take them on one at a time. When you
kill one you get "Raw-Wilderness," which doesn't really do anything for you.
Furthermore, you have to remove EVERY limb of EVERY boss to win.

Patience is the name of the game though, if you take your time you should get
through this without much incident. Try not to use any rejuvinators.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       CV5.17: Sacred Cubivore Clearing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is where you will fight the Killer Cubivore and the four divabeasts. All
of them are Rage six-limbs, and all very troublesome. You will have no snack
grass, and rejuvinators should be saved for the Killer. Divabeast flesh gives
you a lot of HP so they should be your primary source of health.

If you did not get Zen as your EZ-mutate for 100, but did get it as your
"Strongest form," then you should kill the Divabeasts in a Red, Purple,
Blue, Yellow pattern so as not to mutate. Luckily, you DON'T have to take
every bit of meat from the divabeasts.

Ok, this battle is fought initially by running around the perimeter of the
stage. If the Killer comes near, get the hell out of there.

*Rage Redaped:
Your primary target, the rage red turns invisible. You can see its outline, but
it is invincible until it attacks you. Let him target you, dodge the attack and
try and get a few hits in on it before the rest of the Divabeasts

*Rage Purpial:
He can spin to dizzy you, resulting in a gang beating from the others. You
could even make him the primary target. You have to try and get behind him.
Remember, Rage Purples hold their heads behind them, so he can keep up a steady
pace while bashing you. Loop around, hit, run, repeat.

*Rage Yellowbrate:
His rolling ball attack is long-range and you shouldn't attack him like this.
Run circles around him until he stops, pound on him once or twice, run and
repeat.

*Rage Bluocytes:
This guy hits hard and far, but if you get close to him you can run around
snacking him and he will have trouble responding.

*Killer Cubivore:
Killer Cubivore is a Zen, and very powerful. You can only rip off one piece of
his meat at a time. If he reduces you to or close to zero, use a rejuvinator.

If you have to melee with the Killer up close, blocking is your best option. If
he makes a little jump, block. He will do minimal damage and you will actually
have room to respond with your own attack.

If you can get away, camouflage yourself and come up behind him. Attack and
repeat the pattern.

When he is down to 1-limb he has a dizzying spin (run away if he gets it in on
you) and a damaging roar (and the damage isn't neglible). He will actively
pursue you now, so dodge and strike him. But if you can get away, camouflage
really, really helps at this point.

When the Killer is down, enjoy the ending.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

After you beat the Killer Cubivore, you'll be able to replay the three laps of
the game: pig, bear, and bird. This lets you get more mutations all the way to
150.

There are new beasts, such as clash and rage in the Pig and Bear laps. Bosses
as well have more cronies nearby. All the special stages you would have passed
are active as well.

You can exit a lap at will, from the start menu. But it lets you save your
mutations and not your location. You should be able to clear this mode much
more quickly than you did the first time.

Also note that all bits, training grounds, and rejuvinators are back. This
means you can max out your stats.

This part of the guide is based on the rest of the guide written here, but you
can pretty much do them as you please. Mating is often the best way to get
difficult forms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               CV6.1: Paw Dunes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paw Dunes is pretty much the same as it was before, except that you now have
access to the Special Stage, Meatmaze, and there is a Clash Purpial available
outside of this area.

Eat the Clash Purpial, Rag, to take on this form. Enter the special stage.

******************************************************************************
                                   Meatmaze

There are six beasts to get in here. Avoid the dark Greyodons and make your
way to the 6 rage and clash beasts. You can better find your way through
Meatmaze if you float your camera as high as possible. Also, watch for beasts
roaring from behind hedges.

You only have 5 minutes, so you may have to get a few, exit the lap, and
re-enter. It's only the first stage anyways.

*Clash Grey and Clash Blue:
These guys are more centred in the maze. If you make it to them, eat blue first
and then grey.

*Rage Purpial and Rage Grey:
You'll find these guys if you head toward the Southwest of the maze. You'll
have to get into them still, but you'll locate them more easily. Eat the Rage
Grey, then Rage Purpial if you want to move quickly or Rage Purpial then Rage
Grey if you want to easily beat the next guys.

*Rage Red and Rage Blue.
At the Northwest, near the exit you'll find Rage Blue and Rage Red 1-limbeds.
As a Rage Grey, defeat both of these guys (get them to zero), and eat them.
Otherwise, eat Red then Blue. They often run out of their cavern.

******************************************************************************

After the Meatmaze, finish the stage.

When you mate, take a clash or Rage form - particularly Clash Grey. We'll need
some speed for the special stage.

******************************************************************************
                                   Budokan

You only have 5 minutes, and a lot of work to do. A FAST EZ mutate is
especially useful. The Rage Greys in Budokan are on top of the mountain with
one rage beast of every colour. There's single-limbs with rage meat near each
giant statue - which tells you the colour of those around it.

The only form we aren't getting is Clash Yellow. That and Clash Grey, but we
already have that.

*Yellowbrates:
Head to the statue, eat the little guy here, then head on top of the mountain
and eat the two-limbed. This will land you the 2-Limbed Rage form, Curtsy

*Bluocytes:
While you are up on the mountain, eat the 2-limbed Bluocytes. This will land you
the Clash Blue form, Backpacker. Retreat to the Blue statue area and eat the
1-limbed here for the Rage Bluocytes, Paperfan. 

*Redapeds:
Head onto the mountain and eat the Redaped, getting you Clash Red, Spurs. Now,
head down to the Red Statue and eat the 1-limbed here for the Rage Beast,
Flute.

*Purpial:
Head to the purple statue and get some Rage meat from the 1-limb. Now, head up
the mountain and eat the 2-limb for the Rage form, Slouch.

*Greyodon:
Quickly defeat and eat the Rage Greys on the mountain for the Rage form, Ken.

******************************************************************************

Now, complete the stage.

Mupopo Desert offers a CHANCE to get a Rage yellow, if you clear out the
Wildabugs near the boss and manage to get 2 Rage yellow from the Sumo. You can
then diet plan the Shotput to get a third Rage Yellow.

But this is very aggravating, and you can much more easily get Rage Yellow in
the bird chapter.

With 2-limbs, eat the shotput, making SURE you get Rage yellow. Now, eat the
Piccolo and we'll get the Clash Yellow we missed out on back at Budokan,
Shotput.

Get to the 3-Limbed stage, but there's nothing new to get here with 3 limbs.

Mate, and take Clash Grey as your form. This is not NEW but the speed will help
in the special stage.

After you mate, eat the Yellowbrates near the mating grounds for 2 tiles of
Rage Yellow. Enter Snake in the Grassland again...

******************************************************************************
                             Snake in the Grassland

Alright, there are some Rage colours available here this time through. Remember
that cubivores appear in the squares of grass. RUN if a Scenturion spots you.

*Yellowbrates:
Eat the Knockknees in the Northwest. You'll get rage Yellow, Openknees.

*Purpials:
Eat the Rage Purpials in the North. You'll get the rage form, Squat.

*Redapeds:
Head to the Southeast. There are four Piccolos scattered around here. Eat them
all for Rage Red: Keyboard.

*Bluocytes:
West and Northwest of the Oasis. Eat the Rage Blues for Ceilingfan.

*Greyodon:
There are Clash Greys in the West, North, and East. Diet plan a Grey square
off of each of them. Leave the Grassland and return to the Lake with your 3
Rage grey tiles...

******************************************************************************

Kill the 2 bosses here and DO NOT eat and colours. When you go through the
door you will face a 5-limbed Clash Grey, Evicted. Knock it out and Diet plan
its grey tile, and you will get the Rage Grey form, Jen.

Finish the stage.

                               CV6.8: Ultimarsh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should have 100% Mating Success by now, take Rage Blue, Yellow, or Red as
your new form as you don't have either. ALL forms are available in the Special
Stage.

******************************************************************************
                             Smorgasbord Clearing

You have ten minutes, and this is rather easy. You can do this in a different
order if you need clashes, but let's go for Rage beasts. You can skip whatever
one you got from mating.

*Yellowbrates:
They're right near where you start. Eat the Rage yellows here for the Rage
Yellow form: Bowlegs.

*Purpials:
East of the yellows, you will find Purpials. Eat the rage beasts here for the
Rage form: Yoga, if you didn't have it already.

*Redapeds:
Northwest of Yellows, eat the rage beasts for the 5-limbed rage form: Organ.

*Bluocytes:
Northeast of the Yellows, eat the rage beasts here for A.C.

*Greyodons:
North of the Yellowbrates. If you couldn't get Chen in Venery Beach, now is
your chance. You may as well get it before you leave for an easy time with the
District attorney.

******************************************************************************

Now you just need to complete the stage. There's Clash Yellow, Purple, and Blue
outside of the special stage if you're missing a form.

***5-Limbed Rage Yellowbrate: Bowlegs
***5-Limbed Rage Redaped: Organ

                              CV6.9: Paw Pasture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Near the mating grounds there is a Spurs, kill it to geta  1-limbed Clash
Redaped: Howdy.

Be careful fighting the second boss, kill its Rage Purpial friend first.

***1-Limbed Clash Redaped: Howdy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         CV6.10: Verdigrass Highlands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mate, and choose the Rage Greyodon, Len. You CAN get it in the stage, but it's
not easy.

Alright, complete the lap of the stage. The Beastructions in the small room
with all the wildabugs have been doubled, there are now 4.

Rage Grey: We got this from mating, but if you need to, here is a method:

Eat the Freeloader in section 1. Enter the special stage, Cat Trails.

******************************************************************************
                                  Cat Trails

5 Minutes. Only bother with this if you are getting Len. Find and eat the
Freeloader (it runs) and find the clash grey, Mansion, diet plan the grey tile
and you'll take the form.

Head around the perimeter of the mountain. It could take some time to find the
Freeloader, and it runs away. Len is much better to get through mating.

******************************************************************************

Rage Purpial:
Eat the Rag in Section 1, and Diet plan a Purple tile from the Cleaner. Eat the
Rag near the Cleaner for Rage Purpial: Squat.

Rage Yellowbrate:
Eat the Backpacker in Section 3 and isolate the Yellow. Diet Plan the Shotput
here as well, and then leave the stage. We'll get this form in the next area.

147 Mutations, 2 New:

***3-Limbed Rage Purpial: Squat
***3-Limbed Rage Greyodon: Len (mating)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV6.11: Killing Plains
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diet plan a Clash Yellowbrate here for the 3-Limbed Rage Yellow, Knockknees.

148 Mutations, 1 New:

***3-Limbed Rage Yellowbrate: Knockknees 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV6.12: Venery Beach
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the main walkthrough on Venery Beach if you're missing something.
You shouldn't need any new five-limbs by now, however.

What you can do is eat any Pale Greys you find. This will slant the mating
in the next stage in your favour.

This is for a 6-Limbed pale grey form.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            CV6.13: Wildlife Safari
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mate, take the Bedhead if you can. You should be able to with your pale grey
tiles. If not, you'll have to get one from the Pale grey and PaleDarks in the
centre.

What form are you missing in Rage or Clash? Get the colour you need outside
first. Say you need Rage Purpial, Get all Purpials. If you need Clash Purpial,
get some grey before you enter and purple inside the crossing.

This will be your 150th, your emperor. Enter Colorful Crossings and get your
last form (or forms).

150 Mutations, 2 New:

***6-Limbed Pale Greyodon: Bedhead
--------
***6-Limbed Clash Purpial: Sweeper
OR
***6-Limbed Rage Purpial: Sprawl
--------

That's it, you're done.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CV6.14: Shangri-La
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shangri-La is an area with many colourful beasts that will not attack you and
you can eat. They regenerate each morning.

All forms are now EZ-mutate, but you can only use 6-limbed beasts. Shangri-La
takes over the laps, unfortunately. You can't play the main game anymore except
for bosses galore.

There's a couple of unlockables to Cubivore.

Replay:
------

Beating the game's three quests will allow you to go back and play these as
you wish. For instance, you can play the Piggy chapter again.

There are some changes to the levels, special zones will open up and you can
get even more mutations.

Bosses Galore Area:
------------------

To enter these final scenes, you need to have beaten the Chicky chapter and
have at least 100 mutations.

Upgraded Heads:
--------------

If you manage to collect 100 or more mutations your FIRST time through the game
you will get upgraded heads when you go back to replay.

These are simply more detailed versions of the Pig, Bear, and Bird.

Shangri-La:
----------

Activate this mode by getting all 150 mutations. Shangri-La replaces your
ability to replay the laps. It's a single stage with many beasts which are
non-aggressive. All forms become EZ-Mutate, and so you can switch between all
6-limbs freely.

You may want to keep a file near 149 or so if you want to replay laps. You can
still play Bosses Galore with Shangri-La activated, however.

Many thanks to my younger brother, who helped devise some of the eating chains
here and allowed for great brainstorming about how to gain rare forms. Thanks
a lot bro, it wouldn't have been so smooth without you!

Thanks to Saru Brunei for the game's development and Nintendo for publishing
the game in Japan. Saru Brunei doesn't seem to be active any more, but you made
a real gem here. This concept was so amazing, it's onlya  shame the game wasn't
longer or had more exploration to compliment it.

Thanks to Atlus for publishing it outside of Japan. You guys take a lot of
obscure games and provide us with them, and I've appreciated that many times.

Thanks of course go out to my hosts, as without them you would not be reading
this guide.
