3. Introduction

Welcome to my FAQ devoted to one of the most elusive cards in Lost Kingdoms II.
I'm sure everyone knows what I'm talking about. It's the darn Golden Goose!
I decided to write this FAQ to show the easiest and sure-fire way to capture
the Golden Goose! No second player help required!

Here's the Golden Goose's stats:

              mad.

Not exactly, a prize winner, but most likely it's one of the cards that you're
missing.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions or corrections, please send
them to r_mage@hotmail.com I will try my best to answer them, but don't feel
disappointed if I don't answer, I can be busy sometimes [either that or your
incessant spam is driving me insane]. Please include at least the words
"Lost Kingdoms II FAQ" in the heading so I don't ignore it. Also make sure to
read the "Frequently Asked Questions" section just in case your question has
already been answered.

4. Capture the Golden Goose!

-----------------------------
-----------------------------

This method is extremely reliable, but it may take one or two tries to get the
hang of it, but rest assured, you'll be teaching that goose who's boss in no
time at all! Make sure you read the entire method first before attempting
anything since the capture of the Golden Goose usually takes only 10 seconds!


Before attempting to capture the Golden Goose, you'll need to obtain these
cards (which isn't too hard):

   1x #031 Running Bird
   1x #033 Banshee
   1x #046 Gold Butterfly
   2x #226 Capture Card

Both the Running Bird and Gold Butterfly cards can be purchased from the card
shop. You can get the Banshee card by upgrading the Ghoul card (which can
conveniently be bought from the card shop). Lastly, you can get the two
capture cards from the man behind Queen Katia's statue in Kadishu (not the one
on the hill). The first one will cost you 1000 G and the second will cost you
2000 G.

Now start a new deck and put these five cards into it. Select this deck as
your active deck and save your game.

Now reset the game (this way, you can always encounter the Golden Goose on the
first try). When the title screen appears, select VS (make sure there is a
second controller plugged in). Using the first controller, go to P1 OPTIONS and
load your save file. Now exit back to the VS Mode main screen and go to RULES.
Turn on the capture option and return to the VS Mode main screen.

Now start the battle and select Ruldo Forest as the stage. As the battle begins
you should hear and see Golden Goose. Your opening card should consist of 

   #031 Running Bird
   #033 Banshee
   #046 Gold Butterfly
   #226 Capture Card

If it isn't, try again. As soon as you can, Z-Effect the Running Bird and Gold
Butterfly cards and the edges of the cards should turn red. Use one of them
(it doesn't matter which and you don't need to aim at the goose) to perform the
Time Out! combo. This combo will freeze the Golden Goose and keep it still for
a few seconds.

Immediately after using the combo, use the Banshee card once (don't worry about
aiming, this step is to set up the second capture card) Now that the combo has
frozen the Golden Goose, Z-Effect the Banshee card and run up to the Golden
Goose. Use the Banshee card and then use the capture card immediately afterwards.
This should reduce the Golden Goose's HP to a very low level.

After the Banshee card finishes burning out (which shouldn't be too long since
you just used the last charge), the second capture card will take its place.
Use it on the Golden Goose to capture it.

Congratulations! You caught the Golden Goose! Now you can exit the battle and
save your game.

If you botched the attempt or missed throwing the
capture card, you'll need to reset the game before trying again in order to
ensure the Golden Goose appears the first time.

help out!

5. Capture the Golden Goose! - Button Commands

-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

This section goes into detail about which buttons to press and assumes that the
player has performed all the required steps before hand and the duel is
starting right away. For some reason, everytime I use this method, my opening
hand is always in this order:

                   Y-Button
                   ---------
                   [       ]
                   [Gold   ]
                   [Butter-]  X-Button
                   [fly    ]  ---------
        B-Button   [       ]  [       ]
        ---------  ---------  [Capture]
        [       ]             [Card   ]
        [Running]             [       ]
        [Bird   ]  A-Button   [       ]
        [       ]  ---------  ---------
        [       ]  [       ]
        ---------  [Banshee]
                   [       ]
                   [       ]
                   [       ]
                   ---------

I suspect that yours will be the same, so the following button commands will
work only if your cards are in this order.

Hold Z
Press Y
Press B
Release Z
Press B
Keep Tapping A until you use the Banshee once
Run Up to Golden Goose
Hold Z
Press A
Release Z
Press A
Press X (The banshee card animation, may delay this, so keep tapping)
Press A (Capture card should appear in this position)

That should capture Golden Goose!
