Version History:

0.96 -- Nine cards to go!
0.90 -- Nearly there... Corrected all copy costs, as several were wrong due
        to a quirk of switching between pages in the game. Added my LK1
        collection to my LK2 game, which filled in A LOT of holes.
0.80 -- Minor formatting updates, new cards (some just names), added info on 
        capturing. Removed # symbols from upgrade lists, since Lycanthrope's 
        four upgrades would have moved it to a new line (and even then I 
        still needed to eliminate a couple of spaces per line). Gave Stone
        Golem its correct number (whoops... glad no one called me on that).
0.50 -- Initial submission (and acceptance!) to GameFAQS. My first FAQ, 
        I'm so proud. ^_^

II. INTRO
--------------------

Lost Kingdoms 2 is a great sequel to what is considered to be the first
RPG on the Nintendo GameCube. Like its predecessor, it features a unique
card-based combat system that's sort of what you would get if you crossed 
Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh, then decided to NOT aim it at children.

Where the first Lost Kingdoms featured 105 different cards, LK2 adds an
additional 121 to that total, for a staggering total of 226. Nearly all of
the cards from the original are included in the game, although some have been
altered from last year's models; a few appear to have been replaced by new
versions with identical powers but different names, like the original Griffon, 
whose function is now covered by Gnome, but other than that they're all here.

We can discuss the differences between the LK1 cards and their updated 
cousins in a bit. But first, we have to take a brief break to talk legalities. 
I'll keep it quick.

IV. ABOUT THE LIST
--------------------

The list contains the following information about each card:

* Card Number (#) -- This should be self-explanatory.

* Card Name -- Again, fairly obvious.

* Type/Elem. -- Here's where it gets a bit tricky. There are five card TYPES
(Independent, Weapon, Summoning, Helper, and Transformation) and six card
ELEMENTS (Earth, Fire, Water, Wood, Neutral, and Mech; also called Attributes).
Each of these is abbreviated to its first initial, except for Wood, for which I
use "G" (think "grass" or "green") to avoid confusion. The letter BEFORE the 
slash is TYPE, the one AFTER is ELEMENT (just so you know which W means Weapon 
and which means Water). If I don't know one or both, a question mark is holding 
its place.

* Level -- a new feature to LK2, each card has a Level rating. If your rating
in a given element is lower than the level of a given card, your magic stone 
use (and/or HP loss if you don't have enough) will be double the normal amount.

* Copy (Cost) -- The cost of XP, *IN THOUSANDS*, to copy the card at the card
shop. So an entry of "2" would mean "2,000", while "1.8" would mean "1,800".
It's not brain surgery, people -- just math. If a card does not appear in the 
shop under the "Copy" tab, I assume it cannot *BE* copied and thus put "n/a".

* Upgrades -- You can also upgrade your cards if they have enough XP, just like 
in the first LK; a key difference is that in LK1, this function was called 
"Transform". What's the difference, you ask? I've noticed a few cards from LK1 
that used to be "transformable" cannot be "upgraded" in LK2 (the Dragon Knight, 
to name one off the top of my head). Also, I would assume that this keeps 
particularly thick people from getting this function confused with the new 
"Transform"-type cards.

The format for the Upgrades reads as follows: "card number (XP required, *in 
thousands*)". If you have multiple choices for the same XP cost (like with the 
various Lizard Weapon-types), they are included in one entry and separated by 
slashes (e.g. "004/007/039 (2)", which means those upgrades all cost 2,000XP 
each). If I do not definitely know the identity of a particular upgrade, I 
put a question mark and the XP cost. If, when I go into the card shop, the 
card in question does not appear at all, I assume that the card cannot be 
upgraded and say so.

Bear in mind, if you haven't played LK1, that upgrading a card consumes the 
original; you might want to copy it first if you have the spare XP.

Speaking of the original LK, at some point in the game you may be able to 
transfer your collection from that game into this one. As far as I know, this 
may be the only way to get certain cards, but I haven't plumbed the depths of 
the Proving Grounds yet. Bear in mind the following changes that have happened 
in the last 200 years (um... Alanjeh time; 1 year our time):

* As mentioned, some cards that could be transformed in the original cannot be 
upgraded in LK2.
* The very rare cards (you know which ones) can no longer even be copied. For 
some reason, 011 Jack-o-Lantern cannot be copied either.
* Many summonings have been altered; all summonings in LK2 have two effects.
* Some summonings are no longer even summonings! The healing cards are the most
glaring examples of these, as well as most weaker summonings that have 
(usually) become more appropriate weapon cards. Other cards have changed type 
as well.
* Several Independents are now classified as Helpers (traps and shields, 
mostly)
* 008 Unicorn is the only card to have changed element, from Wood to Water.
* A few cards have had their names changed in addition to any other 
alteration...
     023 Water Hopper is now Water Reaper
     056 Giant Bee is now Dryad
     050 MegaMandragora is now King Mandragora
     070 Griffon is now Gnome
     075 Hand of Fire is now Salamander
     087 Water Bird is now Mermaid
     090 Hand of Pain is now Undine
* And finally, some minor changes, such as how many "charges" certain weapons 
have, addition of side-effects (healing, paralysis, etc.), and other tweaks. 
Plus, almost all of the cards have new artwork, but that's not a functional 
change.

Got all that? Good, let's get to the main event then.

VI. SUBMISSIONS/FAQs
--------------------

This list is far from complete, obviously. I've transferred my extensive 
collection from LK1 as of version 0.90, so there are a lot less holes in the 
first half of the list. The rest, as you saw, are just blanks, with a few names
here and there. If you'd like to help out or feel the need to point out 
something I screwed up (I can take it, just be constructive), you can contact 
me via email at vyolynce@earthlink.net. If you know my AIM screen name, you 
can use that as well, but I'm not giving it out here for sanity purposes.

Anyone who gives me information gets a big thank-you and a mention in the Legal 
section to give people a reason to read it. Hey, it's the best I can do on what 
they pay me.

If anyone asks a relevant question, I'll try to answer it in this section, and 
even mention the first person who asks it in an intelligent manner. Here's an 
example of what some of those would look like:

Q: Why don't you include Magic Stone Costs on your chart? (SomeUserName)
A: Two reasons. The first was to conserve space; I wanted to keep each entry on 
one 79-space line. The second was that stone costs are somewhat irrelevant, as 
you can still use a card if you don't have enough stones, and depending on 
levels and/or using the Z-effect (read the manual), actual costs can vary by as 
much as 4x the original cost.

Q: Can you list combos? (SomeOtherName)
A: I could, but I'm not going to. This is a Card List, not a Combo FAQ.

And so on. Please note that any questions following this sentence were actually
submitted by readers like you, although I might have cleaned up the grammar, 
spelling, and/or context a bit.

Q: How do I capture cards? (ShinLinkLivesOn)
A: The manual actually tells you how on page 16, but since not everyone
playing has access to the manual (renters, obviously) and the manual leaves
out one crucial detail, I might as well cover this here. Capturing underwent a
major change from LK to LK2 -- no longer can you execute a "capture throw" with
any card you have. Instead, you may have noticed that card #226 is a "Capture 
Card". Once you get one, include it in your deck. When you find a beastie you
want to capture, weaken it until it's near death. Cycle through your deck to
find the Capture Card, then whip the card at your target (hold down the card's 
button and direct it in-flight to physically tag the monster). If the 
feeble 10ATK hit is enough to kill the monster, you'll know it because you'll 
hear a cool little chime and a pinkish circle will surround the monster, 
sealing it in a card. Just bear in mind that certain monsters (bosses, mostly) 
can't be captured.

Well, the manual covers (most of) that, but here's what it neglects to 
mention: where do you FIND this thing? I wasn't planning on covering 
locations in this, but I'll make an exception here (and on a case-by-case basis 
for ultra-rares, I guess). You buy these from a Rogue in Kadishu, who is 
standing behind the statue near the fountain, for 1000GP... for the first one. 
Each susequent card costs an increasing amount of cash (2000, then 3000, then 
5000; anyone try for a 5th?). Why would you need more than one? Because when 
you successfully use the card (actually capturing a beast, not when you miss 
or when the blow isn't enough to kill), the Capture Card sort of automatically 
"upgrades" itself to whatever you captured, so you lose the actual card.

Sucks, doesn't it? I don't think there are any cards that you absolutely NEED
to capture, however. (I could be wrong.)

Q: Why don't you list attack strength and/or other abilities? (Craig Dennis)
A: Again, mainly formatting reasons. That and I called this FAQ a "Card List", 
which is something I plan on sticking to. My intention was to simply provide 
basic information about the cards, which you can get in the game without needing 
to hit the A button. I provide upgrade information because it can be maddening 
to keep track of that and is a much better method for acquiring most cards than 
spending our life savings on a handful of capture cards; I included copy costs 
since I was already wasting time in the card shops anyway collecting the upgrade 
info and it was easy to collect.

VII. OUTRO
--------------------

Uh... that's it. I want to thank Activision for continuing to put out quality
titles, stretching back to Pitfall on the ol' Atari 2600.

While I'm on the subject of Activision, a big thank you to From Software, who 
took their original game and improved it in nearly every respect for this 
sequel.

And of course, you gotta thank Nintendo for providing the hardware. Lost 
Kingdoms 2 is a GCN exclusive, like its older sister.

Well, those are the big ones. If you read this and liked it, you're welcome! If 
you read this and hated it... well, screw you; nothing I'm gonna say now will 
change your opinion.
