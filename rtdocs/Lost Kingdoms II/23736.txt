Welcome to my FAQ devoted to the cards of Lost Kingdoms II! I hope you find
this FAQ helpful in your adventure.

7. Frequently Asked Questions

--------------------------
--------------------------

Q) How Do you get Lucky Lion?

A) The Lucky Lion card is in a chest inside the bars on a small island on the
   Sarvan Bridge Level. Unfortunately, the switch that opens it gets locked if
   you open the chest in the area below the two raised bridges (there's a large
   stone tablet by it) If you locked the switch by accident, then you'll have
   to start a new game or load a save file to before that happened. To get the
   chest, use a transform card to fly across to it and hit the switch. If you
   needed to start a new game, you can speed things up by trading over a
   transform card that can fly.
