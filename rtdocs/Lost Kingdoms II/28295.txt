I.    Introduction
**********************************************************************
we are MysticWeirdo and zeldafannow also known by our real names
Warren Grieder and Mats Andersson.

<MysticWeirdo>
Since I've finished my first time through Lost Kingdoms 2 in June
2003 I've been answering other GameFAQ's users' questions on how to
locate the various cards in this game, so I've decided write this
guide to help others locate the various cards. I've included the
other two collections that can be viewed the ingame menu: items and
combos.
<end MysticWeirdo>

This is the first guide that we have written.

<MysticWeirdo>
A big thanks to zeldafannow for coauthoring this guide with
the capturable list and filling in the proving ground bonus draw.
<end MysticWeirdo>

Since writing this guide we've written a similar guide for the
original Lost Kingdoms.  It can be found on GameFAQs at:
http://cgi.gamefaqs.com/boards/gentopic.asp?board=19150

III. Ways to Acquire Cards
**********************************************************************

There are several ways that cards are obtained in Lost Kingdoms 2. You
are given a five cards to start the game, some are found in chests,
some are purchased from the card shops or from the Rogue behind the
fountain statue in Kadishu. Some cards will be acquired by upgrading
other cards at the card shop. A few cards will be automatic rewards
for defeating certain enemies, collecting red fairies, or performing
other tasks. There is a card combiner by the fountain in Kadishu who
will make you a card from 2 or 3 other cards. You can import cards
from
Lost Kingdoms 1 after a certain point in the game. When you complete
a level you may be able to draw some cards in the end of level bonus
draws, where the number of cards drawn from a selection of 6 ranges
from 0 to 3 depending on how well you did. Some cards will need to be
captured.

**********************************************************************
III.i    Missable Cards
**********************************************************************
The are three cards that are possible to miss:

Lucky Lion:
The Lucky Lion is in a caged chest in Savran that you need a flying
transformation card like the birdman to reach. However, if you open a
chest containing a Hobgoblin that is beside a sign saying "A treasure
easily attained is a treasure not worth having," the switch that opens
to cage permanently deactivates making it impossible to get the Lucky
Lion.

Chariobot:
Only appears in the Alanjeh Castle timed mission and bonus draw
for the Royal Tower, lower missions.

Barometz
Only appears in the Alanjeh castle timed mission and bonus draw
for the timed mission.


Other cards may be impossible to get again if you use the last one by
upgrading, selling, giving to the card combiner, or betting away in
vs. mode.

**********************************************************************

zeldafannow has informed me that the Jack-O-Lantern in the bonus draw
for one of the Proving Ground levels. It will be one on the cards I've
left a question mark for in the list.

zeldafannow has sent me some more cards in the proving ground
bonus draws: Super Pumper, Fire Elemental on level 4, Earth Elemental,
Wood Elemental, Berserk Master on level 1, Venus Spider of level 6,
Ghoul on level 11, Scythe Beast on level 1, Garuda on level 12,
Panther Mage on level 13, Green Dragon on level 14, Ice Golem on
level 16, and Necromancer on level 18.


Cards in proving grounds draw which we need levels for:
Jack-O-Lantern
Wood Elemental
Super Pumper

**********************************************************************
III.xiii Capturing
**********************************************************************
Cards are captured by hitting them with a capture card (purchased from
the Rogue in Kadishu) after they have been reduced to under 10 hit
points. The Emperor's Dragon Knots attack is a 100% certain capture.
The card making a successful capture is permanently used up until
another one is acquired.

There are very few cards that must be captured. I was only going to
list where a card can be captured if there is no other way, except
for the bonus draw, to acquire the card with some special cases
included. However, zeldafannow has put a lot of hard work into
compiling a complete list which appears at the end of this section.

Necessary captures:
------------------
Pazuzu:
This large bird can be captured in the exit room of level 13 of the
proving grounds. Can only be obtained by capturing.

Golden Goose:
This card only appears in vs. mode in the ruldo forest level.
If you don't have LK1 data to import you'll need to catch it there.


Recommended captures:
--------------------
Barometz:
This card dnly appears during the timed mission at Alanjeh castle.
There are two of them past the red circle gate by the Dark Treant,
which will respawn once. You may want to catch one if you don't
want to chance missing it in the
bonus draw.


Chariobot:
The card only appears during the timed mission at Alanjeh castle.
A swarm of these wheeled mechs attack when you cross the bridge.
You may want to catch one if you don't want to chance missing
it in both of the two bonus draws you get in the Royal Tower,
lower missions.


Emperor:
This is the final opponent in the Proving Grounds found in the
center of level 20. You've likely spent an hour to get to this
point so you may not want to leave acquiring the Emperor to chance
with the bonus draw. The Emperor has 400 hit points so you can use
8 z-powered banshee hits and 2 capture cards as one strategy to
catch it.

Black Dragon:
This card can be caught it during the boss fight in the Krasheen
Mountain or you'll need to go down to level 19 of the proving
grounds to catch one if you miss the bonus draw and don't have
LK1 data to import.


Necessary if you missed their bonus draw:
----------------------------------------

Beaker:
This card in the water type bird that can be found in the
Nobleman's Residence.

Aggressor DX5:
This mech can be found in the Royal tower, (lower or middle) or
Horgozh Town.

Chimera
This card can be caught at the end of the bridge in Savran.

Stone Head
This card can be caught in Bhashea Castle

Juggernaut
This card can be caught in Isamat Urbur after getting the Stone of
Sealing if you don't want to wait until level 6 of the Proving
Grounds to start gathering experience for its Great Turtle upgrade.

Claws-R-Us
This stationary mech can be caught in Alanjeh Castle by the red
circle.

TriBlaster
This missile launching mech can be caught in Horgozh town where
you entered originally, you start at the original exit.

Can be obtained from repeatable bonus draws:
-------------------------------------------
Catch these only if you have enough capture cards and they're the
only cards still missing in your catalog

Vouivre
This card can be caught on level 7 of the Proving Grounds in the room
were you're forced to fight four of them.

Acid Cloud
This card can be caught on level 9 of the Proving Grounds in the
entrance room.

March Hare
This card can be caught on level 13 of the Proving Grounds in the
entrance room.

Valkyrie:
If you sided with Ashura in Sharacia Temple, this card can be caught
on level 4 of the Proving Grounds.

LazerBug 39K
This card can be caught in the Royal Tower, lower in the corridor just
before the lift. You're better off repeating Sacred Battle Arena 2
until you manage to draw a card.

Special:
-------
Elephant:
If for some reason you weren't able to get the elephant from the
card toss you can capture one in the Gromtull Desert.

Jack-O-Lantern:
If you're fortunate enough to see it in the Proving Ground you might
want to capture it .

CircaSaurus:
This card can be found on level 9 of the Proving Grounds if you
couldn't find all the red fairies.

Birdman:
If you want one before the Krasheen mountains use a Hell Hound
to get the across the broken bridge on Bhashea High Road, and catch
one in Bhashea castle if you miss it in the bonus draw for Bhashea
castle.

Doppleganger:
While you'll get one of these automatically when you defeat Katia
you need two of them for one of the combos.  Unless you have LK1
data to import or exploit the vs. mode betting to copy it, you'll
need to catch one of Katia's dopplegangers to be able
to use the combo.


Complete List by level
----------------------

Thanks to zeldafanow for taking the time to compile this list.
Cards that are marked with x# appear in a limited quantity, usually
prior to mission completion where # is the number of occurrences
during the mission.

Cards that are marked "|not catchable" did zeldafannow kill with a
capture card without catching it.  This may be a difference between the 
PAL and NTSC version as some NTSC players have reported capturing some of 
these.

Bosses with |repeatable can be beaten twice or more. the
|not catchable does not apply to the bosses section

Locations within >< are after the mission. if noted by * the monster
is for the mission only.

There appear to maybe be some differences between the cards that a
capturable in the NTSC and PAL versions of the game.
I'll note any differences I've spotted in square brackets.

"dont use any summons and just cast independent creatures. keep attack 
cards with quick use in your hand at all times. if the card you played is 
strong it will be able to hit the knight when you are'nt. if the creature 
dies then cast another. the knight will not be able to attack at all if 
you consistently do this! suggestions on creatures: demon skeleton, the 
lance thing (i cant remember its name. it just looks like a ball with 
legs and a lance out the top), and one of the helper creatures that runs 
around you attacking enemys. with this time your attacks so that it is 
always being hit."

"use this strategy ONLY if you have something that can pick up gems or

or a fafnir an elephant and a type of attacking card. oh yeah and for the 
fafnir and elephant card deck use a superscrubber to collect gems from 
the tentacles after using the attack cards. if you use the 2 fafnir combo 
then just run up and use a fafnir after the other. one attack will take 
it to 1/3 health and the second will kill it. for the elephant and fafnir 
deck  use the fafnir, back up, use the elephants dual restore to get back 
the fafnir, get magic jewels if you need them, and then use the fafnir 
again. rather easy way to kill it. oh and if you have 8 fire stat and at 
least 32 jewels then just use a blue fairy one or 2 times until you get 
fafnir back so you can use it a final time. "

alkaline batterit provides this alternate strategy:  Use skullapalooza. 
The card usage will stay at zero, and if you are good enough, you will

White tiger, Blue Dragon, Golden Phoenix, and Great Turtle:
----------------------------------------------------------

This stragegy courtesy of kirbob:

"I have a strategy for fighting the 4 bosses of the Proving Grounds 
floor 20 (Great Turtle, White Tiger, Golden Phoenix, and Blue Dragon). 
Have a deck with at least 4 capture cards, a God of Destruction card, 
and maybe some Sea Monks or Mind Flayers (in case you fail). Then 
start the battle, get very close to one of them, use the God of 
Destruction card and then use a capture card. This may take a few 
tries to hit them with the God of Destruction, so then you use your 
Sea Monks and Mind Flayers. Doing this, you will easily beat the 4 
monsters and gain there cards in the process. "

This strategy courtesy of Jon Tyler
 "I have a slightly different strategy than the one outlined for taking 
down the Sacred Beasts in the "lock" chamber of level 20 of proving 
grounds (the one that traps you with all four beasts). What you need: 
G.o.D. x1, Doppledanger x2, Decoy Piller x1, any quick weapon or area 
summon. Walk to the edge of the doorway into the chamber (it's the second 
one after the first area with the beasts you can run by) from the Hallway 
and toss a Decoy (doesn't matter if it's Z'd or not, but it helps) as far 
in as possible. Run in. All four beasts spawn. The two medium speed ones, 
the Blue Dragon and the Golden Phoenix should reach it in no time, and if 
you're lucky the Great Turtle will catch up quickly. The White Tiger runs 
around too fast to make it worthwhile. Stand next to the Piller as close 
as safely possible and Summon G.o.D. You should definately get the Blue 
Dragon and the Golden Phoenix, and quite possibly the Great Turtle as 
well. Finish off the two of them with your weapon card. If the great 
turtle got hit, great. Finish him off as well. If not, wing a 
Doppledanger at him and let it do the job. 
Next wing another Doppledanger out and let the White Tiger run into it 
and die. The only catch is that it's heavy on magic stone usage unless 
you're a neutral master. It's worked all the time for me."

MysticWeirdo's strategy:
Lead off with a Berserk Master.  This cause the gods to fight amongst 
themselves (just don't get to close) and the Golden Phoenix will destroy 
itself.  There should be one weakened god left by the time the Berserk 
Master is exhausted.  Use the God of Destruction's Final Judgment and 
finish it off with any attack.


Emperor:
-------
8 Z-powered banshee hits and 2 capture cards or 9 banshee hits.
remember to collect magic stones.

alkaline batterit provides this alternate strategy: Use the vampire, yet 
again.

<MysticWeirdo>
Everyone who posted help back in June 2003 both question and answers
from which I was able to complete my the card catalog on my first
play through, I'm afraid I've forgotten most of your names. The one I
remember are carlash, IceCreamAssassin, JAWBREAKERS, and GCNszmm

Mary570 for saving me a lot of typing by providing a spreadsheet
that had the upgrade from information.

Last but not least I'd like to thank my coauthor zeldafannow
write the section on capturable cards by level, as well as all the
correction/suggestions for the guide, and for sending me the list of
red fairy combos, and filling in many of the gaps in the
proving bonus draw list.
